# Homework (Quadtree Micro-Paper Experiments)
Need to compare performance of a "simple" grid map to a "quadtree" grid map

## Creation of Grid Map (`grid_creation.py`)
1. Time taken to create the grid map
2. Number of cells generated in creation of grid map

## Loop Counting Algorithm (`loop_performance.py`)
1. Time taken to perform the loop counting algorithm
