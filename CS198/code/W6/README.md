- Explore relationship between grid/cell size, data rates and computational cost
    - Does grid spacing have a relationship to the data rate?
    - Upon changing the data rate, evaluate the correctness of algorithm, cost of algorithm
        - Reduce the data rate in DS 1 (1/2, 1/3...)
    - Upon changing grid size, evaluate correctness of algorithm, cost of algorithm
        - If the route is longer, can we affort to make bigger grid sizes?
        - How do our results vary when we adjust the grid size?
    - What metric will we use to check the efficiency fo the algorithm?
