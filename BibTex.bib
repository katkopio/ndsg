	abstract = {Due to the growth of vehicular network and big data analytics, missing data of traffic detector devices become a serious problem in analytics and applications of intelligent transportation systems. The purpose of data imputation is to complete the shortage of traffic data. In this paper, a spatial-temporal based data imputation for GPS probe vehicle in intelligent transportation systems is proposed. In the proposed system, GPS data with speed of vehicles are located into the map within corresponding road segments by GPS coordinates using R+-tree and Dijkstra's algorithm. Then, spatial features are extracted from the current road segment and its two neighboring segments' speeds, and temporal features are extracted from the current time sector, weekday, and speeds of the current road segment in 5 and 10 minutes ago, respectively. After that, each model of road segment is trained by support vector regression with spatial-temporal features for data imputation. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is better than Gaussian processing with time series feature at different missing rates.},

	abstract = {The present paper presents an in-vehicle system for traffic violation alert and management. The system hardware consists of a combination of an on-board computer vision system for traffic sign detection and recognition with a data recorder device for traffic violation alert and management. At present, traffic violations are only focused on three signs: namely speed limit, stop sign, and forbidden turning. The system is designed to warn drivers about potential traffic violations by emitting acoustical messages through vehicle loudspeakers. These messages are issued with sufficient notice to provide the driver with enough time to react to the oncoming traffic situation. However, when a traffic violation is committed, the corresponding offence information such as vehicle speed, GPS location, and other driving parameters, are saved in a database for off-line analysis. In addition, an auxiliary application permits the registered traffic violations to be represented as a standard Google Earth map. The prototype was tested in a real scene under different lighting conditions and showed reasonable results.},

	abstract = {Taxi GPS traces can inform us the human mobility patterns in modern cities. Instead of leveraging the costly and inaccurate human surveys about people's mobility, we intend to explore the night bus route planning issue by using taxi GPS traces. Specifically, we propose a two-phase approach for bidirectional night bus route planning. In the first phase, we develop a process to cluster “hot” areas with dense passenger pick up/drop off and then propose effective methods to split big hot areas into clusters and identify a location in each cluster as a candidate bus stop. In the second phase, given the bus route origin, destination, candidate bus stops, and bus operation time constraints, we derive several effective rules to build the bus route graph and prune invalid stops and edges iteratively. Based on this graph, we further develop a bidirectional probability-based spreading algorithm to generate candidate bus routes automatically. We finally select the best bidirectional bus route, which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions and constraints. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive empirical studies are performed on a real-world taxi GPS data set, which contains more than 1.57 million night passenger delivery trips, generated by 7600 taxis in a month.},

	abstract = {There are diverse sensor applications built into different personal devices, which have the ability to record data related to various aspects of the user. With the ever increasing popularity and lowering costs of such personal devices such as Smart Phones, collecting data from the mobile sensors available in these devices becomes feasible. A wealth of information can be gleaned from such data collected from these sensors which reveals various aspects of the individual's behaviour and activity. Existing approaches for analyzing such data mainly focuses on inferring semantic context and detecting associations from such data. For example, GPS enabled devices allow users to record their movements in the form of spatio-temporal stream points, and meaningful information can be extracted based on different research objectives. In this paper, we have investigated a computation framework in order to identify users' activity categories and their event's associations from GPS trajectory data. This framework has several progressive stages and is designed based on different approaches in each stage, which will facilitate to analyse people's everyday lifestyles that are related to outdoor behaviours. Moreover, we have proposed an approach to improve the performance of the semantic annotation process of this framework, by combining different sources of mobile sensor data (i.e. GPS and audio data). The proposed framework and approaches have been validated on actual data sets which include the Microsoft's Geolife data set and a data set collected by ourselves.},

	abstract = {Maritime boundary violation and intrusion by fishing boats has been a huge concern not only for the errant fishermen and their families but also a massive burden on governments and public alike, due to the complexity of the issue and the naivety of the people involved. The chief solution is to safe guard these fishermen from the danger which they are encountering in everyday life for their livelihood. Hence, keeping the above problems in mind, this paper proposes a GPS based boat detection and tracking system which would safe guard the fishermen from the potential dangers they might face by giving them pre-warning in case of trespassing. In particular, we are proposing to control the navigation so that the fishermen are directed to safe region. This system was designed and demonstrated already. In the proposed system, the maritime boundary is detected using GPS in real time but for our demonstration purposes, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) readers and tags were used in which the location detection and retrieval was followed by the vital information being sent to the Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) for taking corresponding actions.},
