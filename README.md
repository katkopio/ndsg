## Creating Virtual Environment
```
cd code
virtual env <folder>
source <folder>/bin/activate
```

## Install requirements.txt
Navigate into `code` directory
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the Repository
All source codes will go to the `code` folder, separated by `week`, so we can have a copy of each individual week's progress.
